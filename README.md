# CPP fun snippets
This repo is just for fun.

## box.cpp

A box object that can hold all types of pod object. Allow some weired things to be done.

## notype.h

A var class that can hold all types of pod object, even programmer defined types. Operators can be automatically applied, if they are defined.

This is NOT a reflection implementation.

It is just a TOY.
