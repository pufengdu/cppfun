# CPP fun snippets
This repo is just for fun.

## arrayout.cpp

A common stream output template for all types of array. It is just a toy.

## arrayshape.cpp

A toy to extract shape data of a multi-dimensional array for using in runtime.

## box.cpp

A box object that can hold all types of pod object. Allow some weired things to be done.

## notype.h

A var class that can hold all types of pod object, even programmer defined types. Operators can be automatically applied, if they are defined.

This is NOT a reflection implementation.

It is just a TOY.

## podobject.cpp

A proof of concept for extending basic data types in C++. A simple quick and dirty demo of concept to wrap and add member functions for types like int, char, float. 

## utf8.cpp

A demo for programming in Chinese in Codeblocks. This needs C++20 / UTF-8 compiler, and Windows 10. I do not use Windows 11. I have no idea how to configure that registry options in Windows 11.
